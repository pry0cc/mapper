# Mapper - a tool to help the distributed scannning of hosts
I found myself frequently having a lot of masscan outputs in the form of host:port, and I wanted to scan them line by line with nmap service scanning, mapper helps you do that.

###Â Installation

If you have a properly configured GOPATH and $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH, then run this command for a one-liner install, thank you golang!
```
go get -u github.com/pry0cc/mapper
```


#### Cat a very large unsorted wordlist.
```
cat port.txt | mapper
```

This will create an output directory and place output in the format of `ip_port.xml`


Enjoy :)
